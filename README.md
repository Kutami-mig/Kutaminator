<b>"KUTAMINATOR"</b> is a web tool designed to generate automated messages in response to various customer issues, particularly related to missing items or shipping problems. 

Users enter their name, order number, and the missing item details, along with any relevant observations. They then select an appropriate option regarding the issue (such as stock availability, incorrect address, etc.) from a set of radio buttons. The app generates a pre-defined message based on the selected option, which the user can copy and send to the customer.

Iâ€™m aware that there are several errors in the code, and I know a few ways to improve it. However, this tool was developed over a couple of evenings, under time pressure, to be used before the 2024 Christmas campaign, after we were short-staffed. It has not yet been refined because, ultimately, it serves its purpose and continues to be used daily. 

In the near future, I plan to upload an improved version, which will allow me to compare and showcase my progress in JavaScript development.
