"KUTAMINATOR" is a web tool designed to generate automated messages in response to various customer issues, particularly related to missing items or shipping issues. Users enter their name, order number, and the missing item details, along with any relevant observations. They then select an appropriate option regarding the issue (such as stock availability, incorrect address, etc.) from a set of radio buttons. The app generates a pre-defined message based on the selected option, which the user can copy and send to the customer.
